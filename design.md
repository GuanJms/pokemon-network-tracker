# Pokemon Tracking Network with Distributed Capture Task Dispatch

Name: James Guan - james-guan.info

## Overview
This project simulates Pokemon Tracking Network (PTN) with capture dispatch using a queue-based pipeline using Go and RabbitMQ. It demonstrates event-based ingestion, processing, and error routing, that includes sighting pokemon, generate capture task, distribute capture task to agents, and simulate agent capture with failing handling.


## Architecture

### `pokemon_exchange` RabbitMQ Exchange

Exchange routes the pokemon sighting message to pokemon sighting team 

### Queue-based Pokemon Sighting

Each sighting team gets a queue that is register to `pokemon_exchange` exchange with certain topics binding


### Queue-based Pokemon Dispatcher

Pokemon dispatcher (Roket Headquater) will listen to all sighting message at `pokemon_exchange` exchange and generate tasks and send captures to shared-queue `pokemon_tasks` queue directly (default RabbitMQ exchange)

### Share-queue Pokemon Capture Task Distribution & Fail Task Handling

Rocket agent(s) consume a shared queue `pokemon_tasks` with manual acknowledgement. If successful, agent will mark the task done. Otherwise, task will requeue.

### Time-To-Live (TTL) Pokemon Capture Tasks Design with `dead_letter_logger` Error Handling

Each capture task is designed to live certain time, after which task will expired and send to `dead_letter_logger` queue for error handling.
